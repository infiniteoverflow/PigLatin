# PigLatin
For words that begin with consonant sounds, all letters before the initial vowel are placed at the end of the word sequence. Then, "ay" is added, as in the following examples:
"pig" = "igpay" "
latin" = "atinlay" 
"banana" = "ananabay" 
"happy" = "appyhay" 

When words begin with consonant clusters (multiple consonants that form one sound), the whole sound is added to the end when speaking or writing.
"smile" = "ilesmay" 
"string" = "ingstray" 
"stupid" = "upidstay" 
"glove" = "oveglay" 

For words that begin with vowel sounds, one just adds "way" or "yay" to the end (or just "ay"). Examples are: 
"eat" = "eatway" or "eatay" 
"omelet" = "omeletway" or "omeletay" 
"are" = "areway" or "areay" 
"egg" = "eggway" or "eggay"
